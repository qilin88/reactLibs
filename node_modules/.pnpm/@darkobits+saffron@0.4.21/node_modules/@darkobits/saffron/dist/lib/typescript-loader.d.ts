 * This is needed because while we transpile to ESM, we still transpile to CJS
 * for testing in Jest, and certain modules will import different values based
 * on these strategies, so we have to "find" the package's true default export
 * at runtime in a way that works in both ESM and CJS.
 *
 * This is essentially a replacement for Babel's _interopRequireDefault helper
 * which is not used / added to transpiled code when transpiling to ESM.
 *
 * TODO: Move to separate package.
